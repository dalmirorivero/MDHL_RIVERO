        <h2>RULES OF PLAY AND POLICIES</h2>
        <h4>IHF rules shall govern MDHL play except as modified herein.</h4>
        <h3>SPORTMANSHIP</h3>
        <p>
          The common interest that members of the Association share is to
          inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
          Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
          whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
          action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
          accomplishments or standing.
        </p>
        <h3>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS üèí</h3>

            <h3>1. DIMENSIONS</h3>
            <p>
              IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a
              given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions
              should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and
              older.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>2. COMPETITIONS FIELDS</h3>
            <p>
              Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of
              100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in
              the state competition program that are unable to provide a field
              that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
              Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to
              inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a
              waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
              leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
              acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

                areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively
                larger.
